                                &nbsp;Mr.Nimaida, so-called Nobo-san, was born in Ozuchi village and he lives here with friendly cat named "Casa". <br>
                                &nbsp;He once moved out from this village with his family almost 35 years ago, but decided to come back to Ozuchi in order to preserve his hometown.<br><br>

                                &nbsp;When he came back, there were only 2 rice fields remaining but he rebuilt them and succeeded to increase that number to 30 now.<br> 
                                &nbsp;Besides rice making, he also makes charcoal, grows vegetables and mushrooms single-handedly, and goes into the mountain to search for edible wild plants. <br>
                                &nbsp;Even for young people, the way of the mountain is extremely tough and challenging but he is able to explore without any difficulties. For us, we can say that he is one of the most powerful 60s men in Japan.<br><br>
                                                
                                &nbsp;In 2013, he started to invite volunteers from other areas of Japan and from all over the world to visit Ozuchi, in partnership with NGO "NICE". Until now, more than 400 young volunteers from other areas of Japan and about 25 countries have visited and experienced the traditional Japanese life of Ozuchi.
                                <br>
                                &nbsp;Volunteers come to this village to help Nobo-san with farming and charcoal-making work. <br>
                                At night, surrounding the hearth in Nobo-san's house, everyone gathers together to share their thoughts and experiences.
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp;Attracted by the beautiful scenery of Ozuchi, Nobo-san's warm personality and inspired by his way of living, many of these visitors return to visit Ozuchi many times. <br> 
                                &nbsp;2 young people who fell in love with Ozuchi and built a great relationship with Nobo-san actually moved to Kaga-city. 
                                                        
                                Even if his hometown is still facing a crisis of disappearance, Nobo-san keeps challenging himself and working hard in order to preserve this village.
